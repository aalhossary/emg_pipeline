pyemgpipeline Documentation
========================================

**pyemgpipeline** is an electromyography (EMG) signal processing pipeline package.
It implements internationally accepted EMG processing conventions
and provides a high-level interface for ensuring user adherence to those conventions,
in terms of (1) processing parameter values, (2) processing steps, and (3) processing step order.
It is suitable for both surface EMG and intramuscular EMG.

Within this package, class :ref:`DataProcessingManager` is
designed for high-level, guided processing,
and users are encouraged to use it to adhere to accepted EMG processing conventions.
