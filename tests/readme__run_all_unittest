Steps to run all unit tests together:

(1) Activate the Python virtual environment which has the necessary
packages, i.e., numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pyemgpipeline.

(2) Go to the directory where all the test scripts locate.
In general, it is the "tests" directory, which has subdirectories
"test_processors" and "test_wrappers".

(3) Execute the following command:
python -m unittest discover -v

If all succeed, 108 tests will be reported ok.
